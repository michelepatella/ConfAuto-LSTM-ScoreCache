    "Before training, evaluating or running experiments, we need to **generate synthetic data** on which to work on. Data should reflect the nature of the accesses in real-world systems, which is often characterized by:\n",
    "- **Skewed popularity**: Some objects are more popular than others.\n",
    "- **Locality**: Some objects are correlated and are often accessed in sequence.\n",
    "- **Periodic access patterns**: Objects are accessed in recurring time intervals.\n",
    "- **Burstiness periods**: Sudden spikes in access frequency occur during short time periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "To simulate this behavior, we generate two types of synthetic access patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Spatial accesses**: Governed by Zipf distribution (the first keys are more likely to be used than later ones) and locality (after accessing to a certain key, the neighboring ones are more likely to be accessed also). The first access always targets a popular key, then the probability of accessing to a popular key is 30%. After the first access, the probability to access to a neighboring key is 70%.\n",
    "- **Temporal accesses**: Modeled by using a combination of periodic and bursty patterns. While some time periods follow predictable, recurring intervals, others exhibit intervals of sudden, high-frequency access.\n",
    "\n",
    "For doing more realistic experiments, we generate both a **static** and **dynamic dataset**. The first assumes key popularities are fixed over time (i.e., the Zipf parameter remains constant), whereas the second simulates changes in key popularities over time (i.e., the Zipf parameter varies).\n",

    "- `freq_last_1000`: The relative frequency of the current requested key in the last 1000 accesses.\n",
